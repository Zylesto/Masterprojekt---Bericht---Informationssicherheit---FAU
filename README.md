# Template for student work at i1 - Report flavour

Based on previous work by Johannes GÃ¶tzfried and Vincent Haupert. Maintained by Andreas Hammer.

## Usage:

You can copy the contents of this ZIP into a Git repo and it should (hopefully) work out of the box. If you put it into a GitLab project, it should also automatically create a CI pipeline and build your PDF on the server.

Change your name, your report title, advisor and examiner  in the first lines of report.tex.
